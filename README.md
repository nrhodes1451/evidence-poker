Free, disposable poker games

## Disclaimer
This repository was originally created as a fun exercise in RShiny. I wanted to see if it was possible to create a poker website purely in R in memory.

Of course, the scope of the project quickly became unnecessarily cumbersome to maintain with R6 classes and RDS instances. I fumbled around with the concept of running a mySQL instance to handle the DB architecture but quickly decided the idea was unsuitable for RShiny.

The progress so far is left here for posterity.
